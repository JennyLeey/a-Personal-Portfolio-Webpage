      <p>
       The purpose of this manual is to assist you in setting up and using WhatsApp
       Messenger for the delivery of advice. It is important that you keep in mind a few
       things while reading this document.

      </p>

      <p>
        Firstly, it should be read alongside the other materials within the pack, especially
        the Learning Report. Within this report there are recommendations about the
        type of service we believe WhatsApp is appropriate for use with at the time of
        publication. We would strongly urge you to read and consider these
        recommendations before using the platform within your organisation.
      <br>
	  Secondly please keep in mind that we tested WhatsApp messenger with the
      delivery of debt advice within our organisation, Citizens Advice Manchester. The
      accompanying learning report as well as the Evaluation Report goes into detail
      about the type of service within which the platform was tested. It would be
      useful to keep this in mind when drawing your own conclusion about the
      platform’s appropriateness for use within your organisation.
	  </br>
	  <br>
	  Finally, keep in mind at all times that the information within this pack may
      become outdated given the speed of technological change and advancement.
      WhatsApp is continuously being updated and improved by the developers and
      as such, some of the screen shots and the way in which specific parts of the
      application are accessed may change over time.
	 </br>
	 </p>
	 <p>
	   This first section of this guide focuses on the delivery of money advice using
       WhatsApp. This contains practical tips and guidance as well as a brief look at the
       WhatsApp desktop application, which we used to to organise and respond to
       messages using a computer. The second section is more focussed on the
       technical side of things, showing you how you can set up WhatsApp on your
       phone and on your computer.

	  <br>
	   The final section looks at the newly released WhatsApp Business Application
       which offers some additional features which will be useful for an organisation
       using WhatsApp to communicate with their clients.

    <header><u>Delivering money advice -Tips & Guidance</u></header>
    <article>
      <p>Delivering money advice using WhatsApp is unlike other channels. It can be
thought of as a hybrid of email and webchat. The convenience and flexibility that
the platform offers clients mean some will message in with the expectation of a
back and forth instant messaging scenario, much like webchat. Others may wait
hours or even days in between responses with the chat more closely resembling
email.
<br>
Here’s a picture to show how the service worked in terms of new clients
accessing debt advice using WhatsApp.
<img src="image/page.jpg" style="align:center;">
</br>
</p>

<p>
 <b> Setting client’s expectations</b> - it should be made clear on your website or
wherever there is information about the service how long clients can expect to
wait before a response to their message. We used two working days and found
this offered a nice balance.
</p>

<p>
<b>Encourage client to provide initial overview of problem</b> - to avoid something
along the lines of “hi, hello” and nothing more in an initial message. This was
something we encountered quite frequently and it meant that it took longer to
give the client the advice.
</p>

<p>
<b>Managing chats</b> - It is important to use your own personal judgment when
managing chats. Some clients will be more open and provide a lot of information
up front, all at once. Others may be more closed and provide information in
smaller chunks, resulting in some longer back and forth conversations. Try and
apply a consistent rule such as if a client has not responded within a set time
(such as a few days) the chat can be ‘closed’.
</p>

<p>
By closed, we mean that:
      <ul>
        <li>
        the content of the chat is copied into your case management system
        </li>
   		<li>
		any shared documents are downloaded and attached to the client’s case
        file
        </li>
		<li>
		 the conversation is deleted from the phone
		</li>
		<li>
		the client is sent a message to confirm that their enquiry has been closed
		</li>
      </ul>

	 <section class="main-section" id="Delivering_money_advice">
	<header><u>Using the WhatsApp Desktop Application</u></header>
    <article>
	<p>While this may change in the future, at the time of writing and based on a review
on software available at the time, the WhatsApp desktop application was the
most suitable software for accessing and using WhatsApp on a computer. Later
in the guide we will explain how to set up WhatsApp on your phone and your
computer and how to connect the two.
<br>Although the platform has some great features there are some limitations worth
knowing about.</br>
</p>

<p>
<b>The Phone</b> - you will only be able to access WhatsApp on your computer if you
have a working mobile phone with you. If someone on another computer wishes
to access WhatsApp then they can do so, but they will need the phone to log in.
<br>Once a phone is logged in on one computer it will automatically be logged out of
the other computer being previously used. This means that you cannot have
multiple people using WhatsApp at one time.</br>
</p>

<p><b>Contacts </b>- It’s best to add the client as a contact on the mobile phone when the
first message has been received. This has to be done on the phone itself. We
would recommend saving the client under a reference number; we used the
number generated when creating a profile on our case management system.
<br>This means the client remains anonymous on the phone and allows you to easily
search and find them on WhatsApp.</br>
</p>

<p id="call">
<b> Tip - Adding Contacts: When adding a client you need to ensure their number is saved using the country code.
For the UK this is +44. See below:
- [country code] + [Full Phone Number]
- So 07123456789 should be saved as +447123456789
We found that saving contacts on your phone without the area code occasionally meant
they could not be found on WhatsApp.</b>
</p>
<p>You can read more about adding contacts on Android devices here ​<a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/android/21082107 " target="_blank">Adding
 contacts on Android FAQ</a></p>
<p>
<b>Chats</b>​ - Once you have finished with that particular client the WhatsApp
conversation should be deleted. As well as protecting client information this
means that your phone’s message list does not get clogged with dozens of
different client conversations.
<br>
<b>Autoresponse​</b> - There are a number of third party apps that offer an
auto-response function for use within WhatsApp. However after extensive
testing none of them worked consistently or were fit for purpose. This is a
feature that is available in the WhatsApp Business App (see relevant section
below) but we did not have a chance to properly test it.
</br>
<br>
<b>Template Responses</b> ​-​
 ​It may be useful to develop a template response that you
can quickly send to all clients when they first contact you.

The contents of this will depend on the sort of service you are operating. We
found this useful for our ‘access channel’ clients, for whom we had no
information about.
</br>
</p>
Here is an example of the message we used:
<p id="call">
<b>“Hi, thank you for your message. My name is XXXX. Your reference number
for this chat is XXXX You should keep a note of this so we can identify you if
you contact us again. Can you please give us an overview of the problem?”
</b>
</p>
<p>
<br>
We also used an additional template to request basic information from the client
(date of birth, gender, postcode), so you may wish to add something to help you
gather whatever data you need at the beginning of the conversation.
</br>
<br>
<b>Templates for non-debt advice </b>- ​because we had clients continually contact us
about other issues, such as Employment, Welfare Benefits, Housing etc we
developed standardised templates to signpost them to our general adviceline or
other specialist organisations, such as Shelter, as we were only funded to deliver
debt advice via WhatsApp.
</br>
<br>
<b>Click to chat </b>- ​A useful feature to implement is to create a ‘click to chat’ link on
your website. This allows clients using their mobile phone to click on your
telephone number on your website and access WhatsApp straight away, without
the need to save the number in their contacts first. When they tap the phone
number WhatsApp will automatically open and they can begin to type their
message to you.
</br>
<br>
You can also create a ​pre-filled message that will automatically appear in the text
field of a chat when they being their WhatsApp message. We used this to
provide a link to the terms and conditions of the service and also to request
basic information from the client.
</br>
There is a detailed guide on how to do this on the WhatsApp website:
<a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/android/26000030/" target="_blank">https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/android/26000030/</a>

</p>
<p id="call">
<b> Tip - Changing Your Call Settings
<br>
We would recommend adjusting your phone setting so that any phone calls go straight
to voicemail, to avoid the issue of having clients call the phone rather than sending a
WhatsApp message.</br>
Unfortunately there’s no way to stop clients making a WhatsApp Voice Call, so we would
encourage you to make it clear on your website and promotional materials that clients
must send a message rather than call, assuming this is how you want to operate your
service.

      <p>
        Below is a witten step-by-step guide for setting up WhatsApp Messenger on an
Android device with accompanying screenshots. If you are using an Apple
iPhone, the process is very similar; you will need to go to the App Store on your
device and download WhatsApp from there.
      </p>
	  <p style="align: center;">
	  <ol>
	  <li>Open Google Play Store on your phone. The icon for this app should look
       like this:
       <br><img src="image/google icon.bmp" style="width:100px; height: 65px;"></br>
      </li>
     <li>
	 Search for WhatsApp on the store and tap on WhatsApp Messenger as it
comes up in the search results.
     <br><img src="image/search.bmp" ></br>
     </li>
	 <li>
	 Tap install to download the app for your phone
     <br><img src="image/install.bmp" ></br>
	 </li>
	 <li>
	 Tap accept to allow WhatsApp access to your contacts, location, and
others.
      <br><img src="image/information.bmp" ></br>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  Tap open once WhatsApp has downloaded on your phone.
	   <br> <img src="image/open page.bmp"></br>
     </li>
	 <li>
	 On the Welcome to WhatsApp screen, tap on agree and continue once
you have read the terms of service
 <br> <img src="image/welcome page.bmp"></br>
	 </li>
    <li>
	Select your country (United Kingdom),
     <ul>
	 <li>enter the phone number of the device you are using,</li>
	 <li>click next</li>
	 </ul>
	 Once you have done this you should receive a six digit verification code, sent to
you by text message
    </li>
	<li>
	On the next screen enter the code
    <br> <img src="image/verify.bmp" alt="code entery"></br>
    </li>
<p id="call">
<b>Tip - No Code?
<br>If you have any problems receiving the message you have the option to ask for it to be
re-sent or to receive it by phone call.</br>
</b>
</p>
<li>
Finally, enter your name and a profile picture of your choosing.
 <br> <img src="image/profile.bmp" alt="profile info"></br>
</li>

</ol>
</p>
      <p>
        It’s up to you what you want to use as your profile picture. We used our logo but
you could also consider using a picture of an adviser with something that
identifies them as working for your organisation, e.g a t-shirt or lanyard with
your branding on.

    <article>
      <p>
	  Once you have your phone set up properly you can download WhatsApp for
your computer and connect it to your phone. This is very important because this
will allow you to read and respond to messages on your computer, using your
keyboard. This is far more efficient and practical then using the phone itself to
send message to clients as many will likely be quite long and detailed.
<br>
It also means you can send and receive documents and images using your
computer. If a client sends you something then you can download it and put it
straight onto your case management system, rather than having to move it from
your phone to the computer first.
</br>
</p>
<p>
<b>Download WhatsApp</b>
<br>
Go to: <a href=" ​https://www.whatsapp.com/download/" target="_blank"> ​https://www.whatsapp.com/download/</a>
You should see the image below on the webpage.
</br>
<br>
<img src="image/download page.bmp" alt="download page">
</br>
Click to download the appropriate version. If you are not using Windows you can
click the ‘not on windows’ link just below to download for Mac.

</p>
<p>
Once you have downloaded and installed WhatsApp on your computer, you
should be met with the screen below:
<br>
<img src="image/set.bmp">
</br>
</p>
<p id="call">
<b>Tip - Pin to Taskbar
<br>
While the application is open, you can right click the WhatsApp logo at the bottom of
your screen and select ‘pin to taskbar’
. This means the WhatsApp logo will stay there at
all times and you can simply click it in order to open the program. A small red
notification will appear when you have a new message.
</br>
</b>
</p>
<img src="image/taskbar.bmp" alt="image of taskbar">
    </article>

    <header><u>Connecting Your Phone & Computer</u></header>
	<article>
    <p>
     <ol>
	 <li>Open WhatsApp on your phone</li>
     <li> Click on the three white dots in the top right hand corner. <br> <img src="image/page.bmp"></br></li>
	 <li>Click​ ‘WhatsApp Web’.<br> <img src="image/settings.bmp"></br></li>

	 </ol>
     </p>
    
    <p>
     The following screen should appear below..​ <b>Click ‘Ok, Got It’​</b> You now need to
lift the phone up to scan the code on the WhatsApp web application (see earlier
screenshot). You simply need to hold the phone up to your computer screen
(you may have to keep it there for a few seconds) and it will automatically sync
the phone with the computer, meaning WhatsApp will now appear on your
computer.
<br><img src="image/scan.bmp"></br>
    </p>
	<p>
	This is what the computer will look like once the phone is connected. Messages
will appear on the left hand side.
<br>
<img src="image/connect.bmp"> </br>
</p>
<p id="call">
<b>Tip - Access Through Your Web Browser
<br>
There is also a way to access WhatsApp on your computer without downloading it. You
can go to <a href="https://web.whatsapp.com/" target="_blank">https://web.whatsapp.com/</a> directly and access it this way. However we have
recommend that you download WhatsApp to your computer because in our experience
it ran more smoothly and was quicker. However online access could be useful in certain
situations, such as if you are using a colleague’s computer temporarily.

    <article>
      <h2><b>Receiving Documents</b></h2>

      <p>
        WhatsApp makes it very easy to send and receives images, documents and other
files. This is very useful when advising clients as they can easily take and send a
photograph of any paperwork relevant to their enquiry. This ensures that you
are able to give accurate advice. It also means that you can easily send
documents, such as a financial statement, from your computer to the client.
<br>
You can read the full evaluation report for more feedback from clients and
advisers about using WhatsApp to send and receive documents.
</br>
<br>
If a client sends an image, it should appear on the message as below.
Click on the arrow on the top right hand corner of the image and click
‘download’. This file will save on your computer, typically as a jpeg file.
</br>
<br>
<img src="image/chat.bmp">
</br>
      </p>
	 <h2><b> Sending Documents</b></h2>

      <p>
        Click on the paperclip on the top right hand corner. From there you can select
the appropriate icon from photo, camera, document, contact. The most common
will be document if you are sending PDFs or word documents from your
computer, however there may be photographs taken on the phone that you also
wish to send.
<br>
<img scr="image/option.bmp">
</br>
      </p>
      <p id="call">
        <b>Tip - File Sizes
		<br>
WhatsApp supports sending documents in all kinds of file formats but be aware that
there is a file size limit of 100mb.</br>
</b>
      </p>

      <p>
       Shortly after completion of the pilot, WhatsApp released their much anticipated
Business Application. This is a separate app aimed at small-medium size
business/organisations who want to use WhatsApp to communicate with their
customers.
<br>
As of the date of publication this app is free to use and is available to download
for Android devices. It is not yet available for iPhone.
</br>
</p>
<p>
The app is very similar to the standard WhatsApp and you will need to download
it from the play store and verify your phone number in the same way outlined
earlier on in this guide. You can also use it with WhatsApp web (no separate
download is required - it is just one WhatsApp web for both the normal and
business versions) which looks and operates in much the same way.
</p>
<p>
There are still plenty of very useful features unique to the business app which
will help in ensuring a smoother and more efficient service for clients. Please
note we did not have an opportunity to test these features during service
delivery.

    <header><u>Business App Features</u>
</header>
    <article>
	<h2><b>Profile</b></h2>

      <p>
       You can set up a profile for your organisation to give clients more information
about who they are getting in touch with.
<br>
</br>
Tap on the three white dots in the top right hand corner. Go to settings >
business settings > profile.
<br>

From here you can add a photo, business address, category, description,
opening hours, contact details and web address.
</br>
      </p>

     <h2><b>Messaging Tools</b></h2>
      <p>
       Probably the biggest addition in terms of features offered by the Business App
are the messaging tools. They are likely to be very useful for you when speaking
with clients.

      </p>

      <p>
	  <img src="image/message.bmp">
     <br>  <b> Away Message</b> - this allows you to create an automated message for when you are away. For example, this
could be used over the Christmas period if your organisation closes. It can be customised so that it is sent
between a specific time and date range. E.g between 23rd - 31st December. If a client contacts you
during this period they will receive a message explaining the service is closed over the Christmas period.
     </br>
      </p>
      <img src="image/greeting.bmp">
      <p>
        <b>Greeting Message</b> ​-​
 ​this allows you to create and send an automated response to clients when messaging you for the first time or after a 14 day
period of inactivity. This feature will be useful to briefly explain basics of service, e.g expected time for a
response, ask for certain information and/or to direct users to terms and conditions of service.

      </p>
      <img src="image/edit.bmp">
      <p>
	  <b>Quick Replies</b> ​-​
 you can create template responses to suit your needs, for example a thank you message for once the enquiry is
finished. You can then create a shortcut, for example /thanks. So instead of having to type this full
message out each time, you can just type ‘/thanks’ and it will add the full text into the message to save on time.

	  </p>
	  <h2> <b> Statistics</b></h2>
      <p>
	
Another useful feature relates to your data. WhatsApp Business has a dedicated
statistics section which will be useful for helping you to understand how
WhatsApp is working for your organisation. Within this you can keep tabs on the
number of messages that have been sent, delivered and read.
