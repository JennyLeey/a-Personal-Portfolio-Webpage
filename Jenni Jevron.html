Hi and welcome to <b>Jenni Jevron Designing</b>, we deal with the best kind of fashion, new, creative, artistic work. We started off as a one man team but soon became an international multi-billion dollar company due to hard work, motivation and talent.
<br>
Our CEO <b>Jennifer Okitoh</b> started it all a couple of years back when she lunched her first ever line named <b>‘Astrid’</b>, according to this successful designer, she was inspired by a 2018 Rom-com named  <b>‘Crazy Rich Asians’</b>.
</br>
 Being a success the moment it hit the market the fashion icon lunched a new line called <b>‘Love or Lust’</b>,
