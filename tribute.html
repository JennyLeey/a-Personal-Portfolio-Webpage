Michael's prominence propelled him and the television channel        MTV into cultural phenomenons of 1980s pop culture. 
      </li>
      <li>
     In <strong>1983-1984</strong> November 11, Jackson and his brothers partnered with PepsiCo in a $5 million promotional deal that broke records for a celebrity endorsement. The first campaign, which ran in the US from 1983 to 1984 and launched its "New Generation" theme, included tour sponsorship, public relations events, and in-store displays. Jackson helped to create the advertisement, and suggested using his song "Billie Jean", with revised lyrics, as its jingle. On January 27, 1984, Michael and other members of the Jacksons filmed a Pepsi commercial overseen by Phil Dusenberry, and Alan Pottasch -Pepsi's Worldwide Creative Director- at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. During a simulated concert before a full house of fans, pyrotechnics accidentally set Jackson's hair on fire, causing second-degree burns to his scalp.

        <strong>1986</strong> - Micheal's skin had been medium-brown during his youth, but from the mid-1980s it gradually grew paler.

He was diagnosed  with lupus later that year,and was diagnosed with vitiligo in 1986 . Vitiligo's drastic effects on the body can cause psychological distress. Jackson used fair-colored makeup, and possibly skin-bleaching prescription creams, to cover up the uneven blotches of color caused by the illness. The creams would have further lightened his skin, and, with the application of makeup, he could appear very pale Jackson said he had not purposely bleached his skin and could not control his vitiligo
